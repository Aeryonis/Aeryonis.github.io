            <h2 class="h2intro">Discover the World of <span class="mauja">Mauja</span> Le Guin </h2>
            <p class="pbold">
               <span class="mauja">Mauja</span> Le Guin is a sixteen-year-old Inuit girl living in the human world who discovers she is actually from a magical realm called Idavoll.
            </p>
            <p class="pbold">Like a Canadian Harry Potter, <span class="mauja">Mauja</span> Le Guin will delight you if her hangbag does not eat you first! </p>
            <p>
               <span class="mauja">Mauja</span> Le Guin is a sixteen-year-old half-human/half-goddexx. Her mother is the Hag of Bhéara, the Celtic Goddess of Winter, 
               and her father is a human Inuit Medicine Man. She spent her childhood living in the human world in her father’s Canadian Inuit tribe until her 
               powers bloomed when she turned sixteen. She was forced out of the tribe to live in the magical realm where her goal was to find her Goddexx mother, 
               whom she had never known about. On her journey, she learned that there were two realms: the human world, called Midgard, and the magical world, called Idavoll.
            </p>
            <p>The <span class="mauja">Mauja</span> Le Guin Chronicles are a series of novels that follow the Demigod magical medical detective, <span class="mauja">Mauja</span>, and 
                her trusty dog-like sentient handbag sidekick Gerda, on multiple adventures spanning both the human and magical worlds. She learns about the world of Idavoll at 
                Magical Harvard medical school. This school came about during the Salem witch trials in America. In order to keep the peace, the witches made a deal with the ruling 
                Puritans and the governing board of Harvard. They opened up a realm portal with a magical Harvard copy so that all witches and magical beings could attend without persecution. 
                Readers will meet <span class="mauja">Mauja</span>’s best mate Lady Siv, a Nordic Goddexx with sentient kleptomaniac hair, and other magical characters like the Harvard Yard 
                banshee, an amiable ice dragon, Mother Christmas (Or Mrs. Claus), and the Snow Queen herself. The first adventure revolves around the Salem Witch trials in the human world. 
                Helpful traditional northern and arctic Goddexx make appearances, as well as menacing werewolves and warlocks. Mauja unwillingly becomes a problem solver between the two realms. 
                When magical mishaps are afoot, <span class="mauja">Mauja</span> and Gerda are not far behind. </p>
